While NI may in its sole discretion provide you with the applicable key or other access to use the Software prior to receipt from you of the applicable license fees, you will remain obligated to pay such fees to NI.

11.	Copyright; No Other Licenses. The Software is licensed and not sold. The Software, all copies of the Software, related contents, and all rights therein, are owned by NI or its suppliers and are protected by applicable copyright laws and international treaty provisions. All rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved to NI. Further, and without limiting the foregoing, no license or any right of any kind, whether by express license, implied license, the doctrine of exhaustion, or otherwise, is granted under any NI patents (whether identified herein or not) or other intellectual property right of NI with respect to any other product of NI or of any third party, including the right to use any such other product.

12.	Application Deployment

A. 	An "Authorized Application" is (i) an application that you create with a development version of the Software; (ii) an application that you create with third party software using real-time operating system components of the LabVIEW Real-Time Module and the LabWindows/CVI Real-Time Module in accordance with the licenses for such modules; or (iii) an application that you create with a third party software development environment that utilizes Driver Interface Software, if such software development environment is supported by such Driver Interface Software as indicated in the applicable documentation for such Driver Interface Software. "Driver Interface Software" means computer software and other code provided with this Agreement that are listed as hardware drivers or device drivers on NI's hardware driver listing web page, which is currently located at www.ni.com/driverinterfacesoftware, or that are added by NI at any time to such listing or any similar successor listings, together with all accompanying documentation and utilities.

B.	Deployment and Distribution Requirements. You may distribute, deploy, or otherwise make available Authorized Applications, along with applicable runtime engines for the Software and applicable Driver Interface Software that you may include as part of or together with your Authorized Applications, provided that you comply with each of the requirements set forth below.

(i)	You must include the following copyright notice in the Authorized Application's About Box (if applicable) and in any applicable written documentation or, if no such documentation exists, in a "read me" or other .txt file distributed with each copy of the Authorized Application.

"Copyright © [insert year] National Instruments Corporation. All Rights Reserved."

You may instead, or in addition, include your own copyright notice with the notice required above, but in no event may you remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, or other legal notices or disclaimers that exist in the Software and with respect to any runtime engines for the Software and any Driver Interface Software that you include as part of or together with your Authorized Application, your copyright notice will be understood as protecting NI or its licensor's copyrights in the Software and will not be understood as meaning that you have any copyright in or with respect to any Software.

(ii)	You may not use NI's name, logo, or trademarks to market your Authorized Application without NI's express prior written permission.

(iii)	If you distribute to any third parties your Authorized Application with Driver Interface Software or any runtime engine for the Software, you must either pass through to your end users this Agreement or do so subject to your own license agreement that is substantially in accordance with this Agreement and at least as protective of NI as this Agreement.

(iv)	The Authorized Application must not consist of or include any malicious, deceptive, or unlawful programs.

C.	Fees. You may distribute, deploy, or otherwise make available Authorized Applications without paying additional fees to NI. Provided, however, if the Authorized Application was created utilizing any of the software identified in NI's Deployment Licenses listing web page, which is currently located at http://www.ni.com/product-documentation/9561/en/, or any similar successor listings, as such listings may be updated by NI from time to time, or such other software as NI may from time to time designate (any of the foregoing a "Designated Deployment License"), then you must, before distributing, deploying, or otherwise making available the Authorized Application for use on any other computer, either (i) verify that the recipient has a valid license to run the applicable Authorized Application on, or has a valid Deployment License for, each computer on which the Authorized Application will be used or (ii) obtain written distribution authorization from NI and, if required by NI, pay to NI a per copy fee for each Authorized Application distributed, deployed, or otherwise made available. In the case of any Driver Interface Software identified as being subject to the license verification or distribution authorization requirements stated above, if the Authorized Application utilizes, calls, or otherwise accesses any such Driver Interface Software, the Authorized Application will be deemed to have been created utilizing such Driver Interface Software for purposes of this Section. Unless otherwise specified by NI in writing, Designated Deployment Licenses are computer-based licenses and the home usage exception does not apply to Designated Deployment Licenses.

14.	Limited Warranty. NI warrants, for your benefit alone, that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the Software is shipped to you or, if downloaded, from the date the Software is first downloaded by you, (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation that accompanies the Software and (ii) the installation media on which NI provides the Software (if any) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service ("Limited Warranty"). Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of or limitation on duration of an express or implied warranty or limitation on any applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the above limitations may not apply to you; in such event, such warranties are limited to the minimum warranty period allowed by applicable law. The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, improper calibration by you, third party products (either hardware or software) used by you that are not intended by NI for use with the Software, utilization of an improper hardware or software key, or unauthorized maintenance of the Software.

15. 	Customer Remedies. NI's sole obligation, and your sole remedy, with respect to the foregoing Limited Warranty will be to, at NI's option, repair or replace the Software or return the fees paid by you to NI for the Software license, in which event you must return or destroy all copies of the Software in accordance with NI's instructions and the license granted to you will terminate without liability on the part of NI by reason of such termination. NI's obligations as set forth in this Section are contingent on you providing NI with written notice of applicable defects during the warranty period. In addition, you must obtain a Return Material Authorization number from NI before returning the Software under warranty to NI, and you agree to pay any expenses for shipment to and from NI.

16.	No Other Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE BY NI WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE. NI DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION HEREUNDER WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, SOURCE CODE, OR SOFTWARE SERVICES. NI DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SOFTWARE, THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY RELATED SOFTWARE SERVICES, SOURCE CODE, OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE AND DOES NOT WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION REGARDING CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. NI DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, SOURCE CODE, AND SOFTWARE SERVICES.

17.	Limitations Period. You hereby agree not to bring an action to enforce your remedies under the Limited Warranty or for breach of warranty more than one (1) year after the accrual of such cause of action.

18.	Intellectual Property Liability. NI will, at its own expense, defend any claim brought against you by a third party resulting from your use of the Software, to the extent that such claim alleges that the Software infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark of such third party protected by the laws of the U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, or the European Union and provided that such claim does not arise from (i) your use of the Software in combination with equipment, devices, software, or code not made by NI; (ii) your use of the Software in a manner not in accordance with this Agreement or for a purpose not intended by NI; (iii) your failure to incorporate Software updates or upgrades provided by NI that would have avoided the alleged infringement; or (iv) any modification of the Software not made by NI. NI's obligations in this Section are further contingent on you notifying NI in writing promptly upon your obtaining notice of such impending claim and your fully cooperating with NI in preparing a defense. If you provide to NI the authority, assistance, and information NI needs to defend or settle such claim, NI will pay any final award of damages or settlement with respect to such claim and any expense you incur at NI's written request. NI will not be liable for a settlement made without its prior written consent. If the Software is held to be infringing of the rights stated above in this Section and the use of the Software is enjoined, NI will, or if NI believes the Software might be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights NI may, at its option, (i) procure for you the right to use the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software with other software that does not infringe; or (iii) receive your return of the infringing Software and refund to you the license fee payment made by you to NI for the Software. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NI'S LIABILITY, THE LIABILITY OF ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS, AND THE LIABILITY OF ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, UNDER THIS SECTION AND REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR SUCH LIABILITY, WILL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE $50,000 (U.S.). The foregoing states your sole remedy for, and NI's entire liability and responsibility for, infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual or industrial property right relating to the Software. THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE SOFTWARE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.

19.	Limitation On Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NI OR ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING NI'S AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NI OR ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF NI OR OTHERS, AND, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 18, IN NO EVENT WILL NI'S LIABILITIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER UNDER CONTRACT LAW, TORT LAW, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY NI FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE LICENSE. You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices reflect this allocation of risk. To the extent the foregoing limitation of liability is not enforceable or fails of its essential purpose, except for liability for bodily injury or death caused by the Software in the form provided by NI or any liability not capable of being excluded by applicable law, the sole liability of NI to you under or in connection with this Agreement shall be limited to the greater of $50,000 (U.S.) or the license fee paid to NI for the Software.

ADDENDUM C - Volume License Program Terms

Volume License Program ("VLP"). The VLP is a program to assist customers in managing their licenses. The following terms apply to the VLP.

1.	The quote you obtained from NI or its authorized affiliate regarding the VLP and the VLP Startup Kit ("VLP Documentation") is incorporated into this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the VLP Documentation, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will control.

2.	Term. The VLP will be effective the date that NI sends the VLP Startup Kit to you ("VLP Effective Date"). The initial term of the VLP will start on the VLP Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year (the "Initial VLP Term"). You may renew the VLP for additional one (1) year periods (the Initial VLP Term and each such renewal term each referred to herein as a "VLP Term").

3.	Software under the VLP may be used by your employees only on those computers located at the physical location to which NI delivers the Software unless otherwise specified in the VLP Documentation (the "Site"). The definition of "Site" will also include all of your physical locations located within the same country as the Site. In addition, (i) if your Site is located in North or South America, then all of your physical locations within North and South America will be considered in the same country; (ii) if your Site is located in Europe, Middle East, India, or Africa (including Russia and Mongolia), then any of your physical locations within the foregoing regions will be considered in the same country; and (iii) if your Site is located in Asia Pacific, then all of your physical locations in the region will be considered located in the same country. If you purchase a global VLP, then all of your locations worldwide will be considered in the same country as the Site; provided, however, that the Software must be managed from the region to which NI delivers the Software. Your use of the Software under the VLP will, at all times during the VLP Term and thereafter, be subject to all terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement regarding the specific type of license you have acquired under the VLP (i.e. named user, computer-based, or concurrent).

4.	You must acquire and maintain during the VLP Term the Software Services for each individual Software license identified in the VLP Documentation and for which NI makes such Software Services available. Software Services will be described in VLP Documentation. NI reserves the right to restrict Software Service to the then most current version of the Software that is commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service for all Software available under the VLP. Unless otherwise agreed to by NI in writing, you must maintain during the VLP Term a minimum of five (5) licenses to a version of a single NI software product that is considered by NI to be a development version.

5.	You must designate an individual in your organization who is responsible for distributing and overseeing the installation and use of the Software, including use of any master installation media and any approved volume license manager, ("Software Administrator") for each Site. You must promptly notify NI in writing of any changes to a Software Administrator.

6.	NI will deliver the master installation for the Software and, if provided for in the applicable written quotation from NI or its authorized affiliate, make available NI's volume license manager to the Software Administrator(s) for internal installation and use by your employees. Software documentation is provided in electronic form only and comes with the master installation for the Software.

7.	You are responsible for ensuring that an Approved Volume License Manager, together with the most current license file provided by NI that controls end-user access to the Software (to the extent NI has made the Software compatible with an Approved Volume License Manager) is in use at all times, during the term of the VLP and thereafter, with the Software. An "Approved Volume License Manager" means NI's computer software for controlling end user access to the Software and that generates applicable usage compliance information ("NI VLM"); FLEXnet or FLEXlm software; or any other third party software approved in writing by NI for controlling end user access to the Software. If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI makes documentation available for the applicable Approved Volume License Manager, such Approved Volume License Manager must be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by NI.

8.	If you have existing computer-based or named user licenses for the Software that are to be covered by the VLP, you must notify NI in writing of the product, platform, and serial number information for each such license. Each such license and the individual serial number for each license will, as of the VLP Effective Date, no longer be in effect and will be superseded by the licenses within the VLP, which will have a single, common serial number. You must provide NI with information reasonably requested by NI in order to establish and administer the VLP.

9.	Concurrent Use License. If you have obtained a concurrent use license under the VLP, you will be bound by the terms for concurrent use licenses, except that the “Site” for the licenses shall be as defined in this Addendum for licenses under a VLP. If you have purchased a global concurrent license, then all of your locations worldwide will be considered in the same country as the Site.

10.	You acknowledge and agree that in no event may your use of the Software under the VLP exceed the maximum total number of licenses set forth in the VLP Documentation in addition to any licenses that may be added to the VLP after the VLP Effective Date and any licenses available through the "Overdraft" feature. You agree to pay for licenses accessed through the Overdraft feature.

11.	Activity Compliance Logs. Upon request, you agree to provide an activity compliance log ("Activity Compliance Log") for each Site to NI promptly. The Activity Compliance Log must be in a format acceptable to NI.

12.	Renewals. If you desire to renew the VLP, you must provide a current Activity Compliance Log to NI at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then current VLP Term. NI or its authorized affiliate will then provide you with a quote for Software Services, any fees for additional VLP licenses added during the VLP Term, including through the "Overdraft" feature, that are applicable ("Additional VLP Fees"), and any fees for new VLP licenses that you request for the renewal VLP Term (the "VLP Renewal Fees"). You must promptly notify NI if the information in the Activity Compliance Log regarding the number of VLP licenses in use changes following your submission, and NI reserves the right to revise the VLP Renewal Fees to reflect any additional VLP licenses used and not reflected in the applicable Activity Compliance Log that you provided to NI at the time you renewed. IF, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM, YOU DO NOT ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE SOFTWARE SERVICES AND ANY ADDITIONAL VLP FEES THAT ARE DUE, (I) THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT VLP TERM AND (II) ALL SOFTWARE SERVICES FOR THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY AND IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM.

13.	Purchase Orders; Invoices. You must submit purchase orders to NI or its authorized affiliate as follows.

i.	for initial activation of the VLP: in the amount specified in the applicable written quotation from NI or its authorized affiliate for initial activation of the VLP license and the initial annual user fee for Software Services within the time-frame specified in the quote provided to you

ii.	for each renewal term: in the amount of VLP Renewal Fees and any Additional VLP Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term

14.	Software Services are charged on an annual basis. Additional VLP Fees will be pro-rated on a quarterly basis, based on the quarter of the VLP Term in which the Software under such VLP license was first used or such shorter basis as NI may designate.

15.	THE SOFTWARE AND THE APPROVED VOLUME LICENSE MANAGER MAY CONTAIN CODE THAT WILL, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF THE VLP, DEACTIVATE YOUR ABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE VLP. NI MAY ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATED LICENSE FILE, BUT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSE FILE FROM NI AND TO INSTALL AND USE THE LICENSE FILE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER DELIVERY OF SUCH LICENSE FILE, BUT IN NO EVENT NO LATER THAN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP. Upon termination of the VLP, you may continue to use the VLP licenses in effect and for which you have paid the required fees to NI or its authorized affiliate prior to the date of termination (the "Surviving VLP Licenses"), provided that all such use is conducted with an Approved Volume License Manager and otherwise pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. IN NO EVENT MAY YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THE SURVIVING VLP LICENSES FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP. ANY REACTIVATION OF THE VLP FOLLOWING ITS TERMINATION WILL BE AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF NI AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO REACTIVATION FEES, AND THE VLP EFFECTIVE DATE THEREAFTER WILL BE THE DATE THAT THE VLP IS REACTIVATED BY NI.

16.	You may obtain individual serial numbers for any of the VLP licenses or Surviving VLP Licenses. There may be a charge for conversion. No more than four (4) such conversions may occur per calendar year.

17.	Software under a VLP license or a Surviving VLP License is non-transferable and you may not, without the prior written consent of NI or its authorized affiliate, distribute or otherwise provide the Software to any third party or to any of your sites or facilities not expressly identified in the applicable documents from NI.
