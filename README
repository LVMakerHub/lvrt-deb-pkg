This repo contains scripts to create a debian package containing a chroot 
environment for the NI-LabVIEW run-time engine for embedded Linux devices.

repository.

Usage
-----
make_deb.sh ROOTFS_TARBALL

The ROOTFS_TARBALL is a tar file of the root file system that should be used 
as the chroot root directory.  It does not require a kernel or bootloader, as 
these are not used in a chroot.  The tarball is most commonly the output from 
building an image in the Yocto project.
